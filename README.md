Team Name- Playing Our Way


We’ve never played this game but did vast research and got to know how the game works how do two users put coins of two different colors, the user who gets four of their coins (whatever color they use) aligned vertically, horizontally or even diagonally, simply wins.
This game is played in a seven column, six row vertically aligned grid.
In our last semester we studied about structured programming, but in this semester it’s the first time we are studying object-oriented programming. It would be real fun making this project using concept of classes and objects.

Strategy-
We decided to start working on the project from today only and you can see all the updates at the git hub repository. 
We’ll keep on surfing more on Google/Wikipedia to get more knowledge on the game.
Taking help from the notes, previous activities and gathering all the information that we can, we’ll make the best connect 4 game.

GitHub- 
We’ll add the GitHub link at the bottom.
